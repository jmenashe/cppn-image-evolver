This image evolver was built to explore the effects of explicit objectives on search.  The application takes images (i.e. those previously evolved by human users in Picbreeder) and attempts to re-evolve them using the same encoding (CPPNs) and the same evolutionary algorithm (NEAT) under automated conditions.  The primary difference is that in Picbreeder images are evolved interactively and discovered serendipitously, while the automated fitness-based evolution attempts to reach such preconceived goals.
