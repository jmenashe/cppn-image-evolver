/**
 * The InputLayer abstracts the input layer of the neural network.  This layer
 * encapsulates the nueral network's input neurons into two distinct invariants:
 * The x and y values (normalized from -1 to 1).  All other inputs are constant
 * or derivable.
 * <p>
 * For example, The bias is set via the parameter table and is constant in a series.
 * Also, the "distance from center" can be calculate from the variables x and y.
 * <p>
 * We decided at design time that no other per-pixel variables would exist for webneat.
 * If a per-image or per generation variable exists, you may add functions within the
 * implementation to set class members.  The x and y values are the only variables
 * that change per pixel.
